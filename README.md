# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering systematically applies engineering principle, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality system

it enables the creation of software application and system that power modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Establisment of software engineering
Development of programming language
The advent of structured programming

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software development
Quality assurance engineer
Project manager
System architect
UI/UX disgner

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall- sequential apporach with distint phases flowing downward like a waterfall
Agile-  iterative and incremental apporach focused on flexibility,collaboration

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPER- writes the code 
QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER- Ensures software quality by desgining and testing applications 
PROJECT MANAGER-oversees the planning,development and excution of software

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
integrated developement engineering- provide tools for writing,debugging and testing code E.g VS CODE
version control system- tracking changes to scource code and coordinating work among team members

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirement
tight deadline
Technical debit
ways to overcome
effective communication
agile methodologies

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
uint testing- testing individual components
system testing- testing the entire software system
acceptance- testing against user requrement
integration- testing interaction btw different components

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is like creating a special recipe for your robot or AI. 
it is important with AI models because it breaks down the step by step details of the information you need

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
